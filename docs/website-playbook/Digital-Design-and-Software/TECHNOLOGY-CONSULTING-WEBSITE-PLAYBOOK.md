### Component Development

#### Navigation Component Pattern
```tsx
const Navigation = () => {
  const [isScrolled, setIsScrolled] = useState(false);
  const [isMenuOpen, setIsMenuOpen] = useState(false);

  // Scroll detection for background opacity
  useEffect(() => {
    const handleScroll = () => setIsScrolled(window.scrollY > 0);
    window.addEventListener('scroll', handleScroll);
    return () => window.removeEventListener('scroll', handleScroll);
  }, []);

  return (
    <nav className={`fixed top-0 w-full z-50 transition-all ${
      isScrolled ? 'bg-white/95 backdrop-blur-sm shadow-lg' : 'bg-white'
    }`}>
      {/* Navigation content */}
    </nav>
  );
};
```

#### Service Card Pattern
```tsx
const ServiceCard = ({ service, className }) => (
  <motion.div 
    className={`card-hover ${className}`}
    initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }}
    whileInView={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
    transition={{ duration: 0.5 }}
  >
    <div className="p-8">
      <div className="flex items-center mb-4">
        {service.icon}
        <h3 className="ml-4 text-xl font-semibold">{service.title}</h3>
      </div>
      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">{service.description}</p>
      <div className="flex justify-between items-center">
        <span className="text-primary-blue font-medium">
          Starting at {service.price}
        </span>
        <Button variant="primary">Learn More</Button>
      </div>
    </div>
  </motion.div>
);
```

### Performance Optimization

#### Core Web Vitals Implementation
```javascript
// Image optimization
import Image from 'next/image';

// Lazy loading for sections
const LazySection = dynamic(() => import('./Section'), {
  loading: () => <div>Loading...</div>
});

// Font optimization
import { Inter } from 'next/font/google';
const inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'], display: 'swap' });
```

#### Animation Performance
```css
/* Hardware acceleration for animations */
.card-hover {
  will-change: transform;
  transform: translateZ(0);
}

/* Reduced motion for accessibility */
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  * {
    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    animation-iteration-count: 1 !important;
    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
  }
}
```
